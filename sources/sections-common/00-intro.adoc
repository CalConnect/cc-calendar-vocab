== Introduction

This document provides terms and definitions used in calendar and scheduling
standards.

This document complements <<iso-34000>> by providing specialized terminology for
calendaring operations, scheduling, consensus building, and temporal
relationships.

This document is created to succeed and supersede corresponding terms in
<<cc_glossary>> and <<cc_dg_glossary>>, but does not replace their terms that
are not defined in this document.
