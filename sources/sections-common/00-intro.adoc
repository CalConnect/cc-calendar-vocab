== Introduction

This document provides terms and definitions used in calendar and scheduling
standards.

It complements ISO 34000 by providing specialized terminology for calendaring
operations, scheduling, consensus building, and temporal relationships.

It succeeds and supersedes CalConnect Document CD 1102 "Calendaring and
Scheduling Glossary of Terms V2.2" published in May 2013.
